<section class="fade-in-section">
  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project is a playful website that recommends songs matching the user’s mood of the day. Inspired by my love for music and the challenge of finding the right vibe, I wanted to create a light, interactive experience that encourages users to reflect on how they feel and discover new music in a fun way. Rather than building a traditional, practical tool, the focus was on creativity and engagement.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Focus: Personalized mood-based song recommendations</li>
    <li>Audience: Casual music listeners exploring new tracks</li>
    <li>Goal: Deliver a fun and intuitive music discovery experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>What I’d do differently:
      This project was developed and deployed using <a href="https://glitch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glitch</a> as part of the coursework requirements. While Glitch is primarily used in educational or prototyping contexts, it helped rapid development and live testing. In future projects, I would deploy using other platforms for greater scalability and performance.
    </i></p>

<section class="fade-in-section">
  <h2>Design & Functionality Overview</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Users choose a mood or take a quiz to find their emotional state</li>
    <li>Receive a song recommendation with options to listen on Spotify, Apple Music, or YouTube</li>
    <li>Refresh recommendation or restart quiz for new suggestions</li>
    <li>Share personalized song links with friends</li>
    <li>Discovery section for browsing artists with info, popular releases, and videos</li>
    <li>Minimal, clean design with a calming animated gradient on homepage</li>
    <li>Color palette combines blue (calm) and orange (energy) to reflect moods</li>
    <li>Typography balances readability and personality using Work Sans and Bebas Neue</li>
    <li>Dynamic JavaScript loading for personalized, engaging interactions (loading messages, mood popups)</li>
    <li>Simple quiz algorithm matches answers to moods using data attributes and tallying</li>
    <li>Song data stored externally in JSON for better scalability</li>
    <li>Randomized, non-repeating song selection with logic to avoid repeats on refresh</li>
    <li>Background colors change according to mood on the song display page</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>What I’d do differently:
    Develop a fully dynamic artist discovery section and unify CSS files for easier management.</i></p>
</section>

<section class="fade-in-section">
  <h2>Reflection & Future Improvements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created an engaging, playful platform that invites mood-based music exploration</li>
    <li>Limited song dataset limits variety; API integration (e.g., Spotify) would improve content depth</li>
    <li>Future plans include user accounts to save favorites and social sharing features</li>
    <li>Mobile compatibility needs improvement, especially for features like copy-to-clipboard</li>
    <li>Design can be enhanced with richer visuals while maintaining minimalism</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>What I’d do differently:
    Conduct mobile-first testing earlier and gather user feedback to optimize quiz accuracy and UX.</i></p>
