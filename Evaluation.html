<h1 class="titleheading">Usability Audit and UX Redesign for a National Sports Website</h1>
<section class="fade-in-section">
    <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
    <p>
      National health and sports organizations often serve broad and diverse audiences, but their websites frequently fall short in usability. I conducted a UX audit and usability testing initiative to evaluate and improve a real-world example: a public-facing sports and fitness site supporting swimmers, parents, teachers, and volunteers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus: Simplifying user journeys and homepage clarity</li>
      <li>Audience: Parents, swimmers, aspiring coaches, volunteers</li>
      <li>Goal: Ensure content is findable and aligned with real-world needs</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>What I’d do differently:
      Involve real users from each key group (e.g., parents, teachers) rather than relying on roleplay alone.</i></p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="fade-in-section">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Moderated usability testing with 3 participants (in-person and remote)</li>
      <li>Used roleplay to simulate different user goals (parent, coach, swimmer)</li>
      <li>Applied think-aloud protocol and tracked non-verbal cues</li>
      <li>Tasked users with finding key info like lessons, events, or pool locations</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>What I’d do differently:
      Recruit more diverse participants and screen for background in fitness or education to reflect actual user base.</i></p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="fade-in-section">
    <h2>Navigation & Layout</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Homepage was overwhelming and unclear — users struggled to grasp the site's purpose</li>
      <li>Menu items were inconsistently grouped; key areas like events and volunteering were buried</li>
      <li>Created a wireframe with simplified homepage layout, focused CTAs, and repositioned links for improved scanning</li>
      <li>Followed principles from Nielsen’s web reading patterns (F-pattern) to reposition key content</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>What I’d do differently:
      Involve a content strategist earlier to audit and rewrite dense or redundant page content.</i></p>
  </section>
  
  <section class="fade-in-section">
    <h2>Usability Issues Discovered Through Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tested real tasks like “Find a pool near you” and “Understand swimming progression stages”</li>
      <li>PoolFinder tool was barely visible — most users failed to find it without help</li>
      <li>Learn to Swim pages were info-heavy and not structured for quick scanning or task success</li>
      <li>Analyzed data via affinity mapping and a rainbow spreadsheet to identify critical usability blockers</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>What I’d do differently:
      Prototype updated flows for tasks like finding a coach or accessing beginner info — then re-test with users.</i></p>
