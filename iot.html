    <section class="fade-in-section">
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          NeuroSync is an IoT-enabled wearable bracelet paired with a mobile app designed to detect seizures and alert emergency contacts, while providing ongoing health monitoring and personalized support for epilepsy management.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="fade-in-section">
        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The bracelet integrates multiple sensors — EDA, accelerometer, gyroscope, peripheral temperature, and heart rate — connected to an Arduino board. Data streams in real-time to a smartphone app, which analyzes signals and sends alerts if seizure activity is detected.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor for emotional and physiological signals</li>
          <li>Motion sensors (accelerometer & gyroscope) to detect abnormal movements</li>
          <li>Peripheral temperature & heart rate sensors for vital sign monitoring</li>
          <li>Arduino-based prototype for sensor integration and data collection</li>
          <li>Mobile app backend processes sensor data and manages alerts</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
        This interdisciplinary project enhanced my skills in IoT integration, embedded systems, user-centered design, and business strategy — all essential for developing impactful tech solutions in healthcare.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="fade-in-section">
        <h2>Project Context & Learnings</h2>
        <p>
          This project was completed as part of a university course, aiming to deliver a holistic approach combining technical development, business analysis, and user-centered design.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I were to develop NeuroSync in a professional business setting, I would prioritize deeper market validation, secure partnerships with healthcare providers, and implement a more scalable backend infrastructure to support real-time data processing and compliance with medical regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although our analysis was comprehensive for an academic project, real-world deployment would also require extensive clinical testing and regulatory approvals.

         <h2>Source Code & More</h2>
            <p>
                Due to time constraints, the Arduino implementation concentrated primarily on the heart rate sensor. While we aimed for full integration of all sensors, the available code currently covers only heart rate monitoring and is not available for sharing at this time.
            </p>
            <p>*Note: The Arduino-based sensor data collection and the mobile app were developed as separate components and have not yet been fully integrated. Future work would focus on creating seamless communication between the hardware and the application to enhance real-time data processing and user experience.
